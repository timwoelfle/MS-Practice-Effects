Woelfle T, Pless S, Wiencierz A, Kappos L, Naegelin Y, Lorscheider J. Practice Effects of Mobile Tests of Cognition, Dexterity, and Mobility on Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Data Analysis of a Smartphone-Based Observational Study
J Med Internet Res 2021;23(11):e30394. [doi:10.2196/30394](https://www.jmir.org/2021/11/e30394/)

Smartphones and their built-in sensors allow for measuring functions in disease-related domains through mobile tests. This could improve disease characterization and monitoring, and could potentially support treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS), a multifaceted chronic neurological disease with highly variable clinical manifestations. Practice effects can complicate the interpretation of both improvement over time by potentially exaggerating treatment effects and stability by masking deterioration.
